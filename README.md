# Methods and Ngspice circuit code to analyze dynamic input capacitance 45nm CMOS
My attention was attracted by a question posted online at Stack Exchange, [How find input capacitance output R CMOS use SPICE](\href{https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/498872/), asking how to measure the input capacitance (and output resistance) of a CMOS NAND gate using SPICE (or descendants of that electronic circuit simulation software). We include here at GitHub a pdf paper *CBCMcmosArticle.pdf* with a detailed discussion of the subject (discussion of standard cell libraries, CMOS layout, appropriate test frequencies, and analysis and repair of the CBCM charge-based capacitance measurement method), *Ngspice-27* code, as well as copies of the *Ngspice-27* manual (to facilitate understanding the circuit code presented), portions of the standard cell library used and BSIM4 model cards, along with a copy of the BSIM4 manual for reference.
